1. Implement the A* search algorithm for the Romania map route-finding problem to find the
shortest path between Zerind and Bucharest. Use straight distance as the heuristic function.
Answer the following questions:
a) What route was discovered?
b) How many nodes were expanded?
c) What is the cost of this solution?

2. Same problem as in 1. with a new evaluation function fâ€™ = (1-w)g + wh, where w = 0.25 and w
= 0.75.
